# Custom Hooks
This template provides a minimal setup to get you know about the custom hooks in React.
## What are custom hooks?
Hooks that you create yourself. 

A C-H is effectively a function, but with following properties:-
1. Uses another hook internally
2. starts with `use`

A few good examples of this can be:
1. Data fetching hooks or useSWR
2. Performance/ Time based - useInterval, useDebounce
3. Browser functionality related - useWindowSize, useOnlineStatus
